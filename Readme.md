# Project Title
Peddy - Pet Adoption Platform

# Description
Peddy - Pet Adoption Platform is a web application designed to help users browse and adopt pets from a variety of pet shelters. It fetches real-time data from an external API to display available pets, along with their prices and additional details. The app provides a user-friendly interface for easy browsing, and features sorting options to organize pets by price.

## Key Features

- Fetches live data of available pets using async/await to ensure users always have access to the latest listings.
- Users can view pets sorted by price, from lowest to highest.
- The website is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes for a seamless    browsing experience.
- Provides a modal popup when a user selects a pet for adoption, which features a countdown timer.
- Gracefully handles errors and API request failures, providing fallback messages to the user.


## ES6 Features Used

- async/await: Used for making asynchronous API calls to fetch pet data.
- Arrow Functions (=>): Utilized for cleaner function syntax and shorter callback functions.
- Template Literals: Used to dynamically generate HTML with JavaScript for displaying pet details.
- let and const: For variable declaration to ensure block-scoped variables and constants.
- Array Methods: Methods like .sort() and .forEach() were used for sorting and displaying pet data.
